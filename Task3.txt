In summary: 
MLE gives the lowest perplexity, and with smoothing, the lower the delta 
the higher the perplexity. The English corpus is larger, so has a larger 
perplexity with all smoothing types. 

MLE gives the lowest perplexity because of the zero probabilities that are 
built into it. These zero cells very effectively limit the branching factor 
of the model. Delta smoothing eliminates those zeroes, and smaller deltas 
ensure that little of the probability mass is spread over unseen words to 
give a more realistic distribution to the vocabulary.
